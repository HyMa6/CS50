webpage
Our first assignment will be to create a homepage of our choice using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
We’ll create four different pages in HTML, each linked to one another somehow. Recall that we can use the <a> tag, with the link to another file in our IDE.
We’ll also use at least five different CSS selectors, for five different types elements, classes, or IDs. And we’ll want to use at least five different properties overall to style our page, and documentation online will help us find what we’re looking for. We’ll also use the Bootstrap library to style at least one of our components, so we don’t have to write the CSS ourselves for that.
Finally, after we’ve written the content for our pages and styled them, we’ll use JavaScript to make our page interactive somehow, through alerts, buttons, dropdowns, forms, intervals, or even more.
Be as creative as you’d like!
